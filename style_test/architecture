Export:

    Preview panel:
        Plot viewport specs drawn objects applying modifiers imposed by the setting from the settings panel

        Draw rectangle with the sizes of the image size data,
        Make the vertexes of the rect clickable and enable rect resizing with mouse dragging also (zooming).
        Make the panel pad when the mouse wheel is dragged like it is in the viewport to modify the data shown in the
        rect of the image.
        Make the parts outside the rectangle a darker color.
